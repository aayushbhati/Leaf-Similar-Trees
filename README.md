# Leaf-Similar Trees

## Problem Description

Consider all the **leaves** of a binary tree. From **left to right order**, the values of those leaves form a **leaf value sequence**.

Two binary trees are considered **leaf-similar** if their leaf value sequences are **identical**.

Return `true` **if and only if** the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are **leaf-similar**.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4]`  
`root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]`  

**Output:**  
`true`  

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`root1 = [1,2,3]`  
`root2 = [1,3,2]`  

**Output:**  
`false`

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in each tree is in the range `[1, 200]`  
* Both of the given trees will have values in the range `[0, 200]`
